      <h2>🧡 For Adopters: Find the Right Soul, Not Just a Pet</h2>
      <p>
        Compawss is your companion on the journey to adoption. We connect you to all adoptable animals listed across shelters in your country — or, in the case of the European Union, from shelters in every participating country.
      </p>
      <p>
        🐞 But we go beyond listings. With our AI Matching System, we learn about your lifestyle, energy level, home environment, and wishes — then gently suggest pets whose personalities and needs are a perfect fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're dreaming of a senior cat, a joyful dog, a clever parrot, a cuddly rabbit, or even a gentle reptile — Compawss helps you find the one who’s been waiting just for you.

      <h2>🤝 For Volunteers: Help Where It’s Needed Most</h2>
      <p>
        Volunteering shouldn’t feel confusing or limited. With Compawss, you can see all the shelters and organizations currently seeking help, both in your country and across borders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you have an hour a week, a special skill, or just a big heart, Compawss matches you with volunteer tasks that truly matter — from walking dogs, caring for exotic animals, helping at events, or supporting online operations.
      </p>
      <p>You choose when and how you give your time — and we make sure it counts.</p>

      <h2>🏢 For Shelters: Share Events, Reach More People</h2>
      <p>
        Shelters and rescues often struggle to promote adoption fairs, open-door days, or fundraising events. Compawss solves that with a built-in AI event booster: just enter your event and we’ll help share it across communities and social platforms, reaching people who care.
      </p>
      <p>Your local event deserves visibility — and your animals deserve a chance.</p>

      <h2>🌿 For Everyone: A Mission of Animal Welfare</h2>
      <p>
        At Compawss, we believe every animal deserves love, care, and a home. With the help of AI, we make the search for meaningful connections faster, smarter, and more inclusive. We care for animals of all kinds — cats, dogs, rabbits, snakes, iguanas, chinchillas, and more.
