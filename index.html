      <h2>💕 For Adopters: Find the Right Soul, Not Just a Pet</h2>
      <p>Compawss is your companion in the adoption journey. We connect you to all adoptable animals listed in shelters in your country — or in the case of the EU, in any participating country.</p>
      <p>🐞 But we go beyond lists. With our AI Matchmaking System, we learn about your lifestyle, energy level, family environment and wishes — and suggest animals whose personalities and needs match yours beautifully.</p>
      <p>Whether you dream of a senior cat, a joyful dog, a clever parrot, a cuddly rabbit or even a calm reptile — Compawss helps you find the one who’s waiting for you.</p>

      <h2>🤝 For Volunteers: Help Where It’s Most Needed</h2>
      <p>Volunteering doesn't have to be confusing or limited. With Compawss, you can see all shelters and organizations currently seeking help — both locally and internationally.</p>
      <p>Whether you have one hour a week, a special skill, or simply a big heart, Compawss connects you with volunteer tasks that matter — from walking dogs, caring for exotic pets, assisting at events or helping online.</p>
      <p>You choose when and how to give your time — and we make sure it has impact.</p>

      <h2>🏢 For Shelters: Share Events and Reach More People</h2>
      <p>Shelters and rescues often struggle to spread the word about adoption fairs, open-door days or fundraisers. Compawss fixes that with our AI-powered event booster: enter your event, and we help share it in communities and social media, reaching the people who care.</p>
      <p>Your event deserves visibility — and your animals deserve a chance.</p>

      <h2>🌿 For Everyone: An Animal Welfare Mission</h2>
      <p>At Compawss, we believe every animal deserves love, care and a home. With AI’s help, we make finding meaningful connections faster, smarter and more inclusive. We care for animals of all kinds — cats, dogs, rabbits, snakes, iguanas, chinchillas and more.</p>
