      <h2>🧡 For Adopters: Find the Right Soul, Not Just a Pet</h2>
      <p>Compawss is your companion on the journey to adoption. We connect you to all adoptable animals listed across shelters in your country — or, in the case of the European Union, from shelters in every participating country.</p>
      <p>🐾 But we go beyond listings. With our AI Matching System, we learn about your lifestyle, energy level, home environment, and wishes — then gently suggest pets whose personalities and needs are a perfect fit. No more scrolling endlessly or missing out on that one special companion.</p>
      <p>Whether you're dreaming of a senior cat, a joyful dog, a clever parrot, a cuddly rabbit, or even a gentle reptile — Compawss helps you find the one who’s been waiting just for you.</p>

      <h2>🤝 For Volunteers: Help Where It’s Needed Most</h2>
      <p>Volunteering shouldn’t feel confusing or limited. With Compawss, you can see all the shelters and organizations currently seeking help, both in your country and across borders.</p>
      <p>Whether you have an hour a week, a special skill, or just a big heart, Compawss matches you with volunteer tasks that truly matter — from walking dogs, caring for exotic animals, helping at events, or supporting online operations.</p>
      <p>You choose when and how you give your time — and we make sure it counts.</p>

      <h2>📅 For Shelters: Share Events, Reach More People</h2>
      <p>Shelters and rescues often struggle to promote adoption fairs, open-door days, or fundraising events. Compawss solves that with a built-in AI event booster: just enter your event and we’ll help share it across communities and social platforms, reaching people who care.</p>
      <p>Your local event deserves visibility — and your animals deserve a chance.</p>

      <h2>🐾 For Everyone: A Mission of Animal Welfare</h2>
      <p>Compawss believes every animal deserves a voice — and a future. We support shelters, adopters, rescuers, volunteers, and communities with tools to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduce overcrowding</li>
        <li>Reunite lost animals faster</li>
        <li>Give visibility to “less adoptable” pets</li>
        <li>Connect people and animals in meaningful ways</li>
        <li>Strengthen the circle of compassion globally</li>
      </ul>
