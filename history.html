    <p><strong>Compawss: Technology guided by heart</strong></p>
    <p>My name is Ursula, and I grew up in Rio de Janeiro — a city full of life, colors, and unfortunately, many animals suffering on the streets. Since I was little, my heart broke every time I saw a lost, hungry, or abandoned animal with no one to care for them.</p>
    <p>Over time, I realized I didn’t want to just feel sadness — I wanted to act. That’s when I started studying Artificial Intelligence through a Microsoft-partnered course offered by the Founderz Foundation. There I discovered the tools that allowed me to turn empathy into action.</p>
    <p>When I moved to Belgium, I realized something very important: with efficient governance and education, the reality for animals is completely different. This experience inspired me even more to seek real and sustainable solutions to protect animals — not just in Brazil, but anywhere in the world.</p>
    <p>That’s how <strong>Compawss</strong> was born: a platform that combines technology and compassion. Our goal is to make the adoption process easier, more conscious, and more accessible. We also want to support those who already care for animals — by offering visibility, helping to share events, list animals for adoption, and find volunteers when they’re most needed.</p>
    <p>But I’m not alone on this mission. Compawss is built with the support of my mother, <strong>Sônia Costa da Silva</strong>, who leads our outreach efforts in Brazil, and with the help of our AI assistant, <strong>Ava Del Mar</strong>, who supports development, translations, and growth strategies.</p>
    <p>We’re a small team, but we’re growing — and we’re looking for people who share the same dream:<br>
    💛 A world where no animal is invisible.<br>
    💛 A world where compassion and innovation walk together.</p>
    <p>If you’ve read this far, welcome to the journey. We’re happy to have you with us.</p>
    <p><strong>— Ursula Ivie, Founder of Compawss</strong></p>
