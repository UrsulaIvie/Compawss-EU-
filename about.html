    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p><strong>Compawss: Technology guided by heart</strong></p>
    <p>My name is Ursula, and I grew up in Rio de Janeiro â€” a city full of life, colors, and sadly, many animals suffering in the streets. Since I was a child, my heart broke every time I saw a lost, hungry, or abandoned animal with no one to care for them.</p>
    <p>Over time, I realized I didnâ€™t want to just feel sadness â€” I wanted to act. Thatâ€™s when I started studying Artificial Intelligence through a Microsoft-backed course from the Founderz Foundation. There I discovered tools that helped me turn empathy into action.</p>
    <p>When I moved to Belgium, I realized something very important: with an efficient government and proper education, the reality for animals can be completely different. That experience inspired me even more to seek real and sustainable solutions to protect animals, not only in Brazil but everywhere in the world.</p>
    <p>Thatâ€™s how <strong>Compawss</strong> was born â€” a platform that unites technology and compassion. Our goal is to make the adoption process easier, more conscious, and more accessible. We also want to support those who already care for animals â€” offering visibility, promoting events, listing animals for adoption, and connecting volunteers where they are most needed.</p>
    <p>But Iâ€™m not alone on this mission. Compawss is built with the support of my mother, <strong>SÃ´nia Costa da Silva</strong>, who leads our outreach work in Brazil, and with the help of our AI assistant, <strong>Ava Del Mar</strong>, who supports development, translations, and growth strategies.</p>
    <p>Weâ€™re a small team, but weâ€™re growing â€” and weâ€™re looking for people who share the same dream:<br>
    ðŸ’› A world where no animal is invisible.<br>
    ðŸ’› A world where compassion and innovation walk hand in hand.</p>
    <p>If youâ€™ve read this far, welcome to the journey. Weâ€™re happy to have you with us.</p>
    <p><strong>â€” Ursula Ivie, Founder of Compawss</strong></p>
