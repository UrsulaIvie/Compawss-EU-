    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p><strong>Compawss: Technology Guided by Heart</strong></p>
    <p>My name is Ursula, and I grew up in Rio de Janeiro â€” a place full of life, colors, and, sadly, countless animals suffering in the streets. From a young age, my heart broke every time I saw a lost, hungry, or abandoned pet with no one to care for them.</p>
    <p>As I grew older, I knew I wanted to do something more than just feel sadness. When I started studying Artificial Intelligence through a Microsoft-partnered course at the Founderz Foundation, I discovered the tools that would finally allow me to act â€” to build something that could <em>really</em> help.</p>
    <p>Thatâ€™s how <strong>Compawss</strong> was born: a platform that uses technology to serve compassion. Our mission is to make adoption easier and more human-centered, while also supporting the amazing people who care for animals â€” by giving them visibility, helping them promote their events, list their adoptable pets, and call for volunteers in times of need.</p>
    <p>I donâ€™t do this alone. Compawss is built with the collaboration of my mother, <strong>SÃ´nia Costa da Silva</strong>, who leads our outreach in Brazil, and our AI assistant <strong>Ava Del Mar</strong>, who supports development, translation, and growth strategies.</p>
    <p>We are a small team, but we are growing â€” and we are always looking for people who share our dream:<br>
    ðŸ’› A world where no animal is invisible.<br>
    ðŸ’› A world where compassion and innovation walk side by side.</p>
    <p>If you're reading this, welcome to the journey. Weâ€™re glad you're here.</p>
    <p><strong>â€” Ursula Ivie, Founder of Compawss</strong></p>
